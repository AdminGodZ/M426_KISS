# KISS Principle Demonstration in Python

## What is KISS?
KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is a design principle that states that systems work best when they are kept simple rather than made complicated. The principle emphasizes that simplicity in design and implementation leads to more maintainable and reliable code.

## Project Structure
This project demonstrates the KISS principle through two Python implementations:

- `good_KISS.py`: A clean, simple implementation following the KISS principle
- `bad_KISS.py`: A more complicated version showing what happens when we don't follow KISS

## The Example
The example demonstrates a simple task: **Shopping Cart Total Calculator**

### Good Implementation (Following KISS)
- Simple function to calculate total price
- Clear input and output
- Straightforward calculations
- Easy to understand and maintain

### Bad Implementation (Not Following KISS)
- Unnecessary classes and methods
- Overcomplicated data structures
- Extra steps that aren't needed
- Harder to understand and maintain

## Why This Example?
This example shows how a simple task (adding up prices) can be either:
- Solved in a simple, straightforward way
- Made unnecessarily complicated

The difference shows why KISS is important:
- Simple code is easier to understand
- Simple code has fewer bugs
- Simple code is easier to maintain
- Simple code is easier to test

## How to Run
```bash
python good_KISS.py
# or
python bad_KISS.py
```

## Learning Points
- Keep solutions as simple as possible
- Don't add complexity unless it's really needed
- Clear and direct code is better than clever code
- If a simple solution works, use it
